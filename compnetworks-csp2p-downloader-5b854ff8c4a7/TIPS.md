# Part A #

1. You are strongly encouraged to run and thoroughly understand these ["hello world" socket programming examples](https://bitbucket.org/compnetworks/sockets/src/master/). To be able to do part A, you need to be able to clearly articulate what a "reliable bytestream" means as opposed to an "unreliable datagram".

2. Use `telnet` as shown in several class exmaples to "speak" TCP-based protocols as a quick manual (non-programmatic) check that they work as expected.

3. You can use our servers or run the server yourself on your local machine by following the instructions [here](https://bitbucket.org/compnetworks/csp2p/src/master/) for testing and development before you submit your code to Gradescope's autograder.

4. Do not submit to Gradescope until you are done with development and testing as the Gradescope autograder server will be unnecessarily slow.

5. More tips or FAQs to be added here based on class questions.
